# crypto-steg
Encrypting text using Cryptography module in python by generating a key along side. Then sending the key by embedding it with in a Image using steganography technique.
To run this code you need to insatall Pillow, tkinter, cryptography. 

Encryption Decryptio app is for encryption and decryption
In the encryption app after putting the string the first cipher text it generates that is the encrypted message.
And then below it there would be a small sting which is the key.
In stegranography app you need to take an png image
And in the image you need to embed the secure key. By clicking ont he encryption switch.
After encrypting the image You can do the decode. And then you could retrive the key.
After that you can take the key and go to the encryption decryption app.
And select decryption option from the top. 
And put the key and the cipher text.
And it will decode the entire cipher text and give you the message
That's it. Enjoy
Thank you for checking it out.
