# crypto-steg
Encrypting text using the Cryptography module in Python by generating a key alongside. Then the key by embedded within an Image using the steganography technique.
To run this code you need to install Pillow, tkinter, and cryptography. 

Encryption Decryption app is for encryption and decryption
In the encryption app after putting the string the first cipher text it generates is the encrypted message.
And then below it there would be a small sting which is the key.
In steganography app, you need to take a png image
In the image, you need to embed the secure key. By clicking on the encryption switch.
After encrypting the image You can do the decode. And then you could retrieve the key.
After that, you can take the key and go to the encryption-decryption app.
Select the decryption option from the top. 
And put the key and the cipher text.
And it will decode the entire cipher text and give you the message
That's it. Enjoy
Thank you for checking it out.
